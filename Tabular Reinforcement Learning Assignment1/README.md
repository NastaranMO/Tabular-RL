## Introduction

Implementing various tabular-value-based reinforcement learning from scratch, including value iteration, 1-step Q-learning, SARSA, n-step Q-learning, and Monte Carlo.
Addressing issues of model-free RL approaches from exploration, credit assignment and back-up depth.
All experiments averaged over 20 repetitions, with accurate and fair results.
Comparing model-based and model-free methods
Studying the exploration exploitation trade-off
Comparing e-greedy and softmax policy

## Installation

The project does not have any installation requirements except a Python 3.7+ environment. No additional libraries need to be installed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Running all experiments by executing `python Experiment.py`.
3. Analyze `exploration.png`, `on_off_policy.png`, `depth.png`, and `nstep_annealing.png` on the projects's root folder to see the results.
